# first of all, see this link: [https://ncahp.lovable.app/permanent-registration](https://ncahp.lovable.app/permanent-registration). there are 2 main forms here for which they have been completely built and you need to see: form 2a, Temporary Registration

(Foreign nationals). form 2b,  Regular Registration (Foreign Qualification)
(Indian nationals with foreign qualification). first of all observe the flow of each of these forms exhaustively and comprehensively. then, read thoroughly the 2 .docx files for the respective 2 forms, containing the latest versions which have some changes. note down all of those exact changes in exact places and write in copy-paste friendle format here.

Perfect! I've now reviewed both PDF files comprehensively. Let me compile all the exact changes in a copy-paste friendly format:
